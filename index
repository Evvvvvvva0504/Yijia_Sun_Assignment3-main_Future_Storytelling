                Racial bias on the Internet is called "Techno-racism". It refers to the phenomenon that digital techonology used by government agencies or companies can unwittingly discriminate against people of color. For example, ficial recognition system may mistakenly or failed to recognize a person of black, inducing unexpected consequence. Other Techno-racism includes unemployment fraud systems and risk assessment tools, etc. (Karimi, 2021)

                <em>“A study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology of over 100 facial recognition algorithms found that they falsely identified African American and Asian faces 10 to 100 times more than Caucasian faces.”</em>

                <em>“federal testing found facial recognition technology generally performed better when applied to men with lighter skin and worse on darker-skinned women.”</em>

                Research found that gender-neutral internet searches yield results that nonetheless produce male-dominated output -- for example, when searching gender-neutral word "person" or "human", it turns out that the proportion of male images yielded was higher in nations with greater gender inequality (roughly 90% men to 10% women in Hungary or Turkey!) while lower in nations with smaller gender inequality. (Vlasceanu & Amodio, 2022)

                <em>"Humans increasingly rely on artificial intelligence (AI) for efficient and objective decision-making, yet there is increasing concern that algorithms used by modern AI systems produce discriminatory outputs, presumably because they are trained on data in which societal biases are embedded."</em>
                <br>
                <br>
                <em>“Gender disparity associated with high- vs. low-inequality algorithmic outputs guided the formation of gender-biased prototypes and influenced hiring decisions in novel scenarios.” </em>

                This is hard to generate from the present machine learning algorithm because the algorithm is what humans feed the machine. Nonetheless, the current issue largely results from the lack of black people or women in the tech industry and professions. Clearly, <strong>no black people and women, no inclusiveness of these people</strong>.
                <br>
                The lack of professions for black people and women is largely associated with people’s unawareness that people of color or women can also be smart and strong, thus they give them less education or employment opportunities. In my opinion, the rooted problems lie in that, for the racial bias issue, the civilization of various races is covered under the highlight of technological countries and advanced e-products. This is not to say that historic civilization is eliminated; they are still reported, but without enough emphasis. For the gender bias issue, people recognize women's image from stereotypes and the male gaze, lacking the autonomy to learn female beauty which can also be shown in politics or sports courts with flexibility.

                Whereas high-tech is important, it is also rapid and changing. What’s permanent is <em>culture</em>, <em>civilization</em>, and <em>human values</em>. These are also what AI cannot synthesize, because they belong to the treasure of human intelligence.

                    <strong>ImageNet and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):</strong> One of Fei-Fei Li's most significant contributions is her leadership in the development of ImageNet, a large-scale dataset of labeled images. This dataset played a crucial role in advancing the field of computer vision. Under her guidance, the ImageNet project organized the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC), which led to significant advancements in the accuracy of image classification through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

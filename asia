        The <em><strong>Kaicheng Stone Classics (开成石经)</strong></em> is referred to as 
        the 'largest and most complete existing stone book in China' and is 
        currently exhibited in the first exhibition hall of the Xi'an Beilin 
        Museum. As a designated place for preserving stone inscriptions from 
        various dynasties, the <em>Beilin</em> (Steles Forest) gradually took 
        shape through several relocations of the <em>Kaicheng Stone Classics</em>
        from the late Tang Dynasty to the early Northern Song Dynasty. It can be said that without 
        the <em>Kaicheng Stone Classics</em>, there would be no Xi'an Beilin as it is today.

        In the mid-Tang Dynasty, around 1200 years ago, woodblock printing had not 
        yet been widely used for book printing, and most books in the Tang era were 
        copied by hand. During the reign of Emperor Daizong (唐代宗) of the Tang 
        Dynasty, Zhang Can, a scholar in the Imperial Academy (国子监), meticulously 
        reviewed the <em>Five Classics of Confucianism</em> (儒学五经) and transcribed
         them onto the walls of the lecture hall of the Imperial Academy, providing 
        model texts for the students there. However, over time, due to the peeling 
        and defacement of the walls, the characters gradually became unclear. To 
        address this issue, Qi Hao, the Chief of the Imperial Academy, and Wei 
        Gongsu, a scholar in the Ministry of Rites (礼部), decided to use large, 
        sturdy pieces of wood to create large wooden panels to be placed in front 
        of the walls. They organized the students of the Imperial Academy to 
        rewrite the Confucian classics on these wooden panels, which became famous 
        as the <em>Five Classics Wall Versions</em> (五经壁本) and gained popularity
        throughout the country.<br>
        <br>
        In the fourth year of the Dazhong era of Emperor Wenzong (唐文宗) of the 
        Tang Dynasty (830 AD), Zheng Qin, an academician and lecturer of the 
        Hanlin Academy (翰林院), observed that there had long been errors and 
        discrepancies in the transmission of Confucian classics through 
        handwritten copies, which were difficult to correct due to the continuity 
        of such practices among scholars. He proposed the idea of initiating a 
        revision of the Six Classics and initiated a project modeled after the 
        carving of the <em>Xiping Stone Classics</em> (熹平石经) during the 
        Eastern Han Dynasty at the Imperial Academy. The aim was to rectify the 
        standard texts and provide exemplars for future generations.

        After four years, this proposal was finally approved, allowing for the 
        creation of stone inscriptions of the Nine Classics and works such as the 
        <em>Classic of Filial Piety</em> and <em>The Analects</em> in the two halls 
        of the Lecture Hall at the National Academy. This massive cultural project 
        was overseen by Zheng Qin, who was promoted to the position of Right Chief 
        Minister, concurrently serving as the State Preceptor. <u>In the ninth month of 
        the second year of the Kaicheng era, the stone classics were completed.</u><u>

        The Confucius Institute is a global educational organization that promotes 
        Chinese language and culture. It is named after Confucius, the renowned 
        Chinese philosopher whose teachings have had a profound influence on 
        Chinese society and culture for over two millennia. The primary mission of 
        Confucius Institutes is <u>to facilitate the teaching and learning of Chinese 
        language, foster cultural exchange, and enhance mutual understanding 
        between China and other countries</u>. So far, it has established approximately 
        550 Confucius Institutes and 1,193 Confucius Classrooms established in more 
        than 160 countries and regions around the world, including the United States, 
        the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and numerous countries in Europe, Asia, 
        Africa, and Latin America.<br>
        <br>
        However, it is worth noting that that Confucius Institutes have faced some 
        controversies and criticisms, particularly related to issues of academic 
        freedom and influence. It is criticized as <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3729453-time-to-shut-down-all-confucius-institutes-whatever-they-might-be-called/" target="_blank">vehicles for Chinese espionage and propaganda</a>. 
        These concerns have led to the closure or restructuring of some institutes in 
        certain countries. For example, it is counted that a total of 111 Confucius 
        Institutes have closed or are in the process of closing in the United States.
        It still exists challenges for a unique culture to be promoted globally.

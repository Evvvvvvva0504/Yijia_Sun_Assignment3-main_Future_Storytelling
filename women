        In the vast expanse of the internet, where the exchange of ideas and the amplification of voices have become the norm, it is disheartening that women continue to confront a disquieting undercurrent of discrimination and gender bias. The digital realm, once hailed as an equalizer of voices, has unveiled a complex tapestry of disparities that persistently targets and marginalizes women. From online harassment and gender-based cyberbullying to the perpetuation of gender stereotypes, the internet is far from a safe haven for female voices. 
        Delving deeper into this digital landscape, it is urgent that we need to dismantle these digital barriers and foster a more inclusive and equitable online world.

        "Feminism isn't about making women stronger. Women are already strong. It's about changing the way the world perceives that strength." - G.D. Anderson

      <h3 id="bottom">
        In a world where change is constant, it's high time for the internet and public opinion to shift their perspective towards women. The voices that matter most are those of women themselves. It is women who recognize their own worth, potential, and the boundless contributions they bring to every facet of society. 
        Women figures, like those we've celebrated here, have played a pivotal role in this transformative effort.
        <mark> In ther future, I hope to see more and more figures like that showing up, more and more voice from women can be heard,
          and the public remember that it is the collective power of women and their allies that drives progress. With more different women images flourish
          on both the physical and digital world, a more inclusive, bias-free Internet could be realized.</mark>
